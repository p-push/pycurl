NOTE: You need Python and libcurl installed on your system to use or
build pycurl.  Some RPM distributions of curl/libcurl do not include
everything necessary to build pycurl, in which case you need to
install the developer specific RPM which is usually called curl-dev.


Distutils
---------

Build and install pycurl with the following commands:

    (if necessary, become root)
    tar -zxvf pycurl-$VER.tar.gz
    cd pycurl-$VER
    python setup.py install

$VER should be substituted with the pycurl version number, e.g. 7.10.5.

Note that the installation script assumes that 'curl-config' can be
located in your path setting.  If curl-config is installed outside
your path or you want to force installation to use a particular
version of curl-config, use the '--curl-config' commandline option to
specify the location of curl-config.  Example:

    python setup.py install --curl-config=/usr/local/bin/curl-config

If libcurl is linked dynamically with pycurl, you may have to alter the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable accordingly.  This normally
applies only if there is more than one version of libcurl installed,
e.g. one in /usr/lib and one in /usr/local/lib.


Windows
-------

First, you will need to obtain compiled dependencies. At the very least
you will need libcurl. You can build libcurl yourself which will allow
you to configure which SSL library is used and so on.

When installing on Windows, you need to manually specify the path to
the compiled curl directory containing headers and libraries via
--curl-dir option to setup.py as follows:

    python setup.py --curl-dir=c:\dev\curl-7.33.0\builds\libcurl-vc-x86-release-dll-ipv6-sspi-spnego-winssl
